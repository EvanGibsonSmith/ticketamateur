# Dependencies
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Because this is a react project it can be run with "npm start" in the browser

You should be able to just use "npm install" if you are not just using the src folder.

React is required, including Routes for the project to run.

# Description
This is a basic concert ticket website mockup created for Software Engineering CS3733 with Professor Heineman. Without regard to graphics, this website was a mockup to demonstrate a full working website using AWS. This website was live for a few weeks and demonstrated all of the working components including the SQL backend, REST API, and frontend with javascript and React.

# Features
This website was a general mockup of a working website, in which there were three types of users. There were ticket buyers, venue managers, administrators. By creating a login (which game a random key) and a role you could log in, the ticket buyers can search through venues and buy available tickets through from venue managers. The venue managers can create venues, including the name, time of event, etc. Last, the administrators have the power to remove venues, add venues, reset ticket sales, etc.

# Improvements
This was created without graphics in mind, so the human interaction aspect wasn't really considered.
